# greeffer-creeper
When someone on social media poses a question such as, "what was the name of the actor in that film?" or "can anyone tell me where to find more of this creator's work?" my docker swarm will attempt to provide them with an answer using a variety of means, including keyword context, computer vision, object detection, facial recognition, etc. My last name is Greeff, and scraping social media in search of keywords seems creepy (even to me!) so that's why I named it greeffer-creeper. Plus it rhymes!
